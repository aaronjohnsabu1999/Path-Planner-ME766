# Path Planning using Parallel Computing

The demand for Door-to-Door (D2D) delivery services has seen a huge surge in the wake of the pandemic and lockdowns. Path planning algorithms will play a huge role in the future when delivery is performed autonomously using intelligent UGVs and electric cars. We investigate how path planning technique can be made faster using parallel computing techniques. We perform serial implementations on C++ of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm following which we implement the same with the augmentation of parallel computing platforms such as OpenMP and CUDA. The algorithms are run on two types of databases: a very large graph based on the roadmap of New York state, and smaller randomly-generated graphs of prescribed size. We present the simulation results and provide conclusions based on our inferences from the process of parallelization.
